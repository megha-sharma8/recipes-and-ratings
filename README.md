# Recipes and Ratings

## Introduction

Our analysis uses two connected datasets: interactions and recipes which, together, provide insights into user engagement with recipes. The interactions dataset captures feedback on recipes including through ratings and reviews by people with a timestamp (date column) to mark when the interaction occured. Each row demonstrates the interaction between a user and a recipe. The recipes dataset includes information on the recipes themselves, including the name, preparation time in minutes, nutrional content, steps, ingredients, and even tags. To explore these datasets further, we merged them on recipe id, creating 83,193 rows of what we deemed observable data capturing user engagement and characteristics of recipes.

### Key Question

**How do recipe characteristics, like preparation time and ingredient composition, relate to the healthiness of a recipe, and can we predict the number of calories in a recipe using these attributes?**

### Why Should You Care?

Food has a crucial role in navigating your health and the choices we make can lead to a healthy lifestyle if done so informatively. Understanding relationships between recipe characteristics and their true healthiness can help people determine what healthier cooking habits are, reducing the risk of disease (for example, diabetes). Knowing how ingredient composition of healthy recipes impact caloric content can be especially helpful for those who want to maximize the nutritional value of the calories they eat daily. Our insights are data-driven so that you can use them to make informed decisions on cooking habits and promote your well-being.

### Cleaning the Data

Through our analysis we looked at the relationship between ingredients and healthy recipes based on preparation time.
